# Bemis

All the docs you could ever want! All the docs you could ever need!

Bemis is a mod for writing documentation. It's explicitly intended as a competitor to Patchouli.

Why use Bemis?

- Books are written in XML, not JSON, and laid out like your files are laid out on disk. Stop writing text in a format
  designed for data, and start writing it in a **real markup language**!
- First-class **export to HTML**, out of the box.
- Extensible for developers. Easily add your own page elements and load them seamlessly.
